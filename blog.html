    Welcome to my blog! <br><br>
    
    In this post, we will discuss the impact of Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HCAI) on the data engineering field,
    particularly in terms of workforce displacement. The rapid development of AI technologies like ChatGPT, Jasper.ai, and
    Kore.ai has already replaced many low-skilled jobs that involve repetitive tasks. However, there is a considerable skill
    gap, and new job opportunities are emerging for those with AI expertise. <br> <br>
    
    HCAI is an AI technology that identifies repetitive or mundane daily tasks performed by humans and aims to automate them
    to improve efficiency and reduce errors. As a data engineer, I am interested in understanding the impact of HCAI on the
    data engineering field and developing strategies to help future data engineers cope with these disruptions.<br> <br>
    
    The "Future of Jobs Report 2020" by the World Economic Forum predicts that 85 million jobs will be displaced due to AI,
    and 97 million new jobs will be created. Most of the job displacement is expected to occur in the technology domain.
    Thus, it is essential to prepare for these changes and develop new skills to remain relevant in the workforce.<br> <br>
    
    However, technologies like ChatGPT have their limitations and cannot entirely replace human effort. For instance, this
    AI model is trained till 2021 and is not aware of recent library and code changes in GCP, AWS, and AZURE. Thus, human
    expertise and knowledge are still essential to ensure effective use of these emerging technologies.<br> <br>
    
    As a data engineer, I believe that it is crucial to stay informed and continuously upgrade our skills to cope with the
    evolving technological landscape. This includes staying up-to-date with the latest developments in AI, cloud computing,
    and data analytics, and acquiring new skills to stay relevant and valuable in the workforce.<br> <br>
